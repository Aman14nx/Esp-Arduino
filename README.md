This code controls a stepper motor's movement, simulating a left-to-right travel. It uses a limit switch to stop the motor's movement when pressed, and when released, it changes the motor's direction 
to continue traveling. This simple program can be used in various applications like camera sliders or automated systems that require controlled linear motion with a limit switch for position sensing.
